Banking System

This project was created as part of my internship at The Sparks Foundation under the Global Research Internship Program (GRIP) in December 2023.
It is a simple dynamic website that simulates a banking system. It allows users to view all customers, select and view individual customers, transfer money between customers, 
and view all transactions. The website was built using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL.

## Features
- **View All Customers:** Check out the list of all customers.
- **Select and View Customer:** Get detailed information about a specific customer.
- **Transfer Money:** Transfer funds between different customers.
